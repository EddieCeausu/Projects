4) An error in the compiler appears due to sumgrades not being
   initialized
5) The while loops enters an infinite loop. This is due to done being
   a boolean and being intialized as false and starting the while loop
   as false. Done would become true when answer equals the string
   yes. If this never occurs the while loop never ends.
6) The initial while loop will not finish. This occurs from done
   only becoming true if answer = "yes" all lowercase. Any other
   instance will result the while to loop again. EZ fix would be to
   call .toLowerCase() on answer.
7) No the for loop skips over the first class entered
8) if (!senior && goodgrade && nrabsences) {
	System.out.println("You can drop your lowest 100 point grade.");
  } else {
  System.out.println("You cannont drop your lowest 100 point grade.");
  }
